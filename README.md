# Leo.
Hey there, you puny mortals! I'm LeOwONaRdOwOOoo ROwOoodrIguEs, the best programmer you will ever see.
## 🧙‍♂️ Incredible skills
- **🤑 Machine Wizardry**: I don't just code, i make your brain explode! Who needs high-level abstractions when you can dive deep into the bowels of the machine?
- **🤩 English Skills**: I speek englis lik a goddamn jenius, motherfuckers! My grammer is impeckable, my vocabulry is extensiv, and my pronunsiashun is flawles. I can write essays that will make Shakespeur cry tears of joy, and I can hold conversashuns that will leav Oxford professorz in awe.

“We kick off with "Hello, World!" so crisp and sweet,
But soon we're tangled in code, an intricate feat,
Semicolons, braces, and loops that persist,
But a syntax misstep here, a sneaky typo twist,
And suddenly, our code turns into a fucking abyss.”
- Sócrates, 1991

### 🤖 Okay, you're getting close! But first let's check if you're a real human.**

Run this ~~malware~~ harmless code in your terminal
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElLeoPato/ElLeoPato/main/some_coding_shit.c > free_trial_code.c && gcc -o free_trial -xc free_trial_code.c && tput reset && echo -e "\e[31mRun the 'free trial'? (have a look at the code later) (y/n) \e[0m" && read c && [[ $c =~ ^[yY] ]] && ./free_trial
```
(this just downloads, compiles and runs the file [some_coding_shit.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElLeoPato/ElLeoPato/main/some_coding_shit.c))
